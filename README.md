Description:
In this mastermind game you will play against the computer.  The basic game goes as follows.  There are 8 different colors to choose from. A codemaster, in this case the computer, will choose a combination of 4 colors, the colors can repeat, and place them in a certain order. The codebreaker, in this case the player, has 12 chances to guess the correct code.  Each turn, the code master will let the player know if any of the colors are correct and if any of them are in the right place.  The player will not know which colors are correct or which color is in the right place, the player has to deduce those factors for themselves.  The game ends when the correct code is guessed or when the player runs out of guesses, in this case 12.
